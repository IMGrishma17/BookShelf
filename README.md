BookShelf is a web application developed as part of my Bachelor’s final year project. It is designed to facilitate the buying and selling of used books. The platform provides an easy-to-use interface where users can list books for sale and browse or purchase books posted by others.

Technologies Used:
ASP.NET — for server-side logic and web forms
C# — for backend programming
JavaScript — for client-side interactivity
CSS — for styling

Project Status
- The full structure of the website was implemented and tested locally.
- The application was not deployed to a production environment.

Notes
- This project was developed for academic purposes.
- The database connection is configured for local testing. Minor adjustments may be needed to connect to a live database or deploy online.
